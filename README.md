# CodeIgniter Github OAuth Authentication Library
Allows CodeIgniter to let users login to GitHub and gain access to their account data and the rest of GitHubs API.

##Getting Started
1. You first need to register your application with GitHub to get your `client_id` and `client_secret`
2. Drag and drop the files in the respective folders (e.g. config/github.php goes into the config file in the CI application)
3. Set the config variables
4. Create button with link generated by `$this->github->generateLoginURL()`
5. Create the redirect URI page, an example of how this could look is below:

```
  public function github_oauth(){
    $this->load->library('github');
    $token = $this->github->getAccessToken();
    
    if($token == false){
      //something went wrong
      redirect('login','refresh');
    }

    //save token somewhere safe
    redirect('','refresh');
  }
```
